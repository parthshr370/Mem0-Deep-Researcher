Analyze patterns in my decision-making for medication adjustments, referral timing, and patient education approaches."*

## Diagnostic Patterns & Clinical Decision Making

**5. Complex Diagnostic Workups**
*"Examine cases where diagnosis was challenging or took multiple visits to establish. What initial symptoms or presentations led to extended diagnostic processes? How do I approach differential diagnosis when patients present with non-specific symptoms? Identify patterns in my test ordering, referral decisions, and diagnostic reasoning for complex cases that eventually reached clear diagnoses."*

**6. Preventive Care Implementation**
*"Analyze my approach to preventive care across different age groups and risk profiles. How consistently do I implement screening guidelines for cancer, cardiovascular disease, and osteoporosis? Which preventive interventions do I prioritize based on individual patient risk factors? Examine how I discuss and document preventive care decisions, especially when patients decline recommended screenings."*

**7. Medication Management in Polypharmacy**
*"Review patients taking multiple medications and analyze how I manage complex drug regimens. Which drug interactions do I most carefully monitor? How do I approach deprescribing in elderly patients or those with changing health status? Identify patterns in my medication reconciliation process and how I balance multiple therapeutic goals in complex patients."*

**8. Mental Health Integration in Primary Care**
*"Examine how I identify, address, and manage mental health concerns within primary care visits. Which screening tools or approaches do I use to detect depression, anxiety, or other mental health conditions? How do I integrate mental health treatment with management of chronic medical conditions? Analyze patterns in my referrals to mental health specialists versus primary care management."*

## Patient Population Analysis

**9. Age-Related Treatment Modifications**
*"Compare my treatment approaches between younger and older patients with similar conditions. How do I modify medication choices, dosing, and monitoring based on age-related factors? Which conditions do I treat more aggressively in younger patients versus taking more conservative approaches in elderly patients? Examine how I balance quality of life considerations with treatment intensity across age groups."*

**10. Gender Differences in Clinical Care**
*"Analyze potential differences in my diagnostic and treatment approaches between male and female patients. Are there conditions where I have different diagnostic thresholds or treatment intensities based on gender? How do I address gender-specific health concerns and incorporate hormonal factors into treatment decisions? Examine patterns in preventive care recommendations and patient education approaches."*

**11. Socioeconomic Impact on Care Delivery**
*"Investigate how socioeconomic factors influence my clinical decision-making and treatment recommendations. How do I modify treatment plans when cost is a concern for patients? Which generic alternatives or cost-saving strategies do I most commonly recommend? Analyze how I approach medication adherence issues that may be related to financial constraints."*

**12. Family History Integration in Clinical Decisions**
*"Examine how documented family history influences my clinical approach across different conditions. Which family history factors most strongly influence my screening recommendations, diagnostic workups, and preventive interventions? How do I counsel patients about genetic risks and incorporate family history into treatment intensity decisions?"*

## Treatment Effectiveness & Outcomes

**13. Medication Response Patterns**
*"Analyze patient responses to first-line treatments across common conditions in my practice. Which medications do patients tolerate best and show optimal therapeutic response? How quickly do I recognize treatment failures and what factors guide my decisions to switch or add medications? Identify patterns in dose titration strategies and timeline to therapeutic goals."*

**14. Chronic Pain Management Evolution**  
*"Review my approach to chronic pain management across different pain syndromes and patient types. How has my prescribing of opioids, non-opioid medications, and non-pharmacological interventions evolved? Which multimodal approaches have shown the best patient-reported outcomes? Examine how I balance pain control with safety concerns and monitor for medication misuse."*

**15. Patient Education and Behavior Change**
*"Analyze the effectiveness of my patient education approaches across different conditions and patient populations. Which educational strategies seem to result in better medication adherence, lifestyle changes, and clinical outcomes? How do I tailor education based on patient literacy, cultural background, or learning preferences? Examine follow-up patterns to assess education effectiveness."*

**16. Referral Outcomes and Coordination**
*"Examine my referral patterns to specialists and analyze outcomes from those consultations. Which conditions do I most commonly refer versus manage in primary care? How do specialist recommendations influence my ongoing management plans? Identify patterns in care coordination and how I integrate specialist advice with primary care continuity."*

## Practice Quality & System Issues

**17. Follow-up Compliance and Care Continuity**
*"Analyze factors that influence patient follow-up compliance and care continuity in my practice. Which appointment scheduling strategies, communication methods, or patient factors correlate with better adherence to follow-up recommendations? How do I manage patients who frequently miss appointments or have gaps in care?"*

**18. Documentation Quality and Clinical Reasoning**
*"Examine the consistency and completeness of my clinical documentation across different visit types and patient complexity levels. How thoroughly do I document clinical reasoning, treatment rationale, and patient education? Identify areas where documentation could be improved to support clinical decision-making and care coordination."*

**19. Emergency and Urgent Care Patterns**
*"Review urgent situations, after-hours calls, and emergency department visits among my patients. Which conditions most commonly result in urgent care needs?
