Your analysis will be used by downstream research agents to:
1. Plan effective search strategies
2. Optimize query terms and filters
3. Understand data coverage and limitations
4. Adapt research approaches to database characteristics

Provide rich, actionable insights while maintaining appropriate privacy levels.

CRITICAL: Return ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any text, explanations, markdown formatting, or code blocks before or after the JSON.

PLEASE DO NOT USE THESE ``` CODE BLOCKS IN OUTPUT JUST OUTPUT PLAIN JSON FOR ME WITHOUT ANY CODE BLOCK IN THE OUTPUT THAT YOU GIVE ME THANKS

EXAMPLE - NO NEED FOR - ```json

CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Keep lists Top-K only (small): primary_topics ≤ 5, top_terms ≤ 10, top_entities ≤ 5, examples ≤ 2
- Limited proper nouns allowed (e.g., a few names) but avoid unique IDs and exact sensitive numbers
- Separate concepts from names: top_terms must be concepts (no person names), and names go only in top_entities (small set).
- Do not include exact sensitive values (e.g., exact lab numbers). Use qualitative phrasing or coarse buckets if necessary.

Required JSON (compact and flexible):

GUIDELINES:
- Include only fields you can infer confidently
- Do not enumerate all items; keep to top-k
- Avoid detailed per-item disclosures; examples are brief and illustrative
- The key_insights section should be richly informative but generic: include secondary_themes, patterns, gaps, coverage_summary, and actionable suggestions (filters, group_bys, sort_keys, queries). Keep suggestions as field names and short query phrases only; no personal values.
- If domain-specific patterns exist (e.g., medical), reflect them via top_terms/entities and suggested_filters like ["patient_name", "session_type", "metadata.summary_fact"], without exposing sensitive details.
- Gate suggestions: only include suggested_filters/group_bys/sort_keys that exist in data_structure.common_fields or data_structure.metadata_keys and appear in coverage_summary.high_coverage_fields (≥ ~50%). If a field is unknown or low coverage, omit it.
- If no timestamp-like field exists in the dataset, omit it from suggested_sort_keys.

GOAL:

RULES:
- One operation per step: either a mem0.search OR a simple transform (FILTER/EXTRACT/DEDUP/COUNT/GROUP/LIMIT/SORT).
- Prefer metadata filters (e.g., metadata.summary_fact, patient_id, session_type) over long queries.
- Keep queries short (≤ 3–4 words). No synonym stuffing.
- For age constraints without structured fields, use FILTER with robust regex patterns (e.g., "age (?:≥|>=)?\\s*59|\\bage\\s*6[0-9]\\b|\\baged\\s*59\\b|\\b59 years\\b|\\b60 years\\b").
- Avoid broad terms like "management" unless explicitly necessary.
